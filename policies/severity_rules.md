# Severity rules

Severity is a *triage label* and should be justified briefly.

## High
- Likely **patient-care impact** (labels/meds/bloods/theatres/ED flow/clinic throughput)
- **Ward-wide** or multi-user impact
- Prolonged open time for a critical workflow (if duration/time-open is known)

## Medium
- Important operational impact for a team/area
- Limited scope (e.g., several users or a single area) without clear patient-care risk

## Low
- Single user or single device inconvenience
- Workaround available / non-critical workflow
