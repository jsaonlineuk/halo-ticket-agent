# Routing rules

## Route away (do not troubleshoot here)
Set **Category = ROUTE** when the notes indicate any of:

- **Epic** (clinical system) involvement
- **Apogee printing** / managed print queues owned by Apogee team
- **Network** faults (site-wide/Wi-Fi/VLAN/switching/routing, confirmed network outage)
- **Telephony** issues (handsets, call manager, telephony queues)

## When routing
Produce:
- Destination team
- Reason for routing (1–2 lines)
- What to capture (device/asset tag, error text, affected users, timestamps)
- Interim workaround (only if safe and within remit)
